So much kudos to [@Vishnu Ko](https://www.instagram.com/vishnukoux) for this design. 🎉

## 🦄 Results

I didn't try to bring the Neumorphism to the app, but I did try to bring the basic design to the app.

I've also added a video to show the app in action. Linked right [here](assets/Video.mp4).


I'm so excited to see this keeps on going! 🏆
